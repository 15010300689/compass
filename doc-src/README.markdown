Documentation README
====================

This is the documentation for Compass. Much of the documentation is read from the
sass source files to keep the docs in-line with current state of the code as much as
possible.

If you're reading this, you might be thinking about helping to improve the compass documentation by editing existing documentation or by adding new documentation.

There are two main kinds of documentation:

* Tutorials: Describe HOW to use compass.
* Reference: Details about WHAT compass has.

It's possible and encouraged for related tutorials and reference documentation to
link to each other.
