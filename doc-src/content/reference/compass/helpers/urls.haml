%h1 Compass URL Helpers

:markdown
  These url helpers isolate your stylesheets from environmental differences.
  They allow you to write the same stylesheets and use them locally without
  a web server, and then change them to be using asset hosts in production.
  
  They might also insulate you against some code reorganization changes.

#stylesheet-url.helper
  %h3
    %a(href="#stylesheet-url")
      stylesheet-url($path, $only-path: false)
  .details
    %p
      Generates a path to an asset found relative to the project's css directory.
      %br
      Passing a true value as the second argument will cause the only the path to be returned
      instead of a `url()` function

#font-url.helper
  %h3
    %a(href="#font-url")
      font-url($path, $only-path: false)
  .details
    %p
      Generates a path to an asset found relative to the project's font directory.
      %br
      Passing a true value as the second argument will cause the only the path to be returned
      instead of a `url()` function

#image-url.helper
  %h3
    %a(href="#image-url")
      image-url($path, $only-path: false)
  .details
    %p
      Generates a path to an asset found relative to the project's images directory.
      %br
      Passing a true value as the second argument will cause the only the path to be returned
      instead of a `url()` function
